Diving is an individual event which is generally the first event to take place at dual meets and takes place simultaneously with swimming events during championship meets.

## Summary

For dual meets, each diver competes six dives.
At championship meets, each diver will compete up to eleven dives.
Each dive will receive three scores from the diving judges, which is summed and then multiplied by the degree of difficulty of the dive.
The cumulative score after all the dives are completed are compared to determine the final rankings.

## Dive Numbers

Each dive is identified by a dive number which describes how it should be performed.

Non-twisting dives have a three digit number followed by a letter, such as 201B.
The first digit is the group (which indicates the direction of spin), the second digit is typically 0 (unless the dive is a "flying" dive, and then the digit will be 1)[^note-on-flying-dives], the third digit is the number of half-somersaults, and the final letter is the position.

[^note-on-flying-dives]: no flying dive has been competed at the high school level in years

Twisting dives have a four digit number followed by a letter, such as 5223D.
The first digit is 5 (for the twister group), the second digit is the direction of spin, the third digit is the number of half-somersault, the fourth digit is the number of half-twists, and the final letter is the position.

### Diving Groups and Direction of Spin

There are 5 diving groups that each correspond with a direction of spin.

| Digit | Diving Group | Direction of Spin                                 |
|-------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Forward      | Facing out<br>Rotating forward                    |
| 2     | Backward     | Facing back<br>Rotating backward                  |
| 3     | Reverse      | Facing out<br>Rotating backward                   |
| 4     | Inward       | Facing back<br>Rotating forward                   |
| 5     | Twister      | Determined by the second digit in the dive number |

### Position of the Dive

There are four different dive positions that are each given a corresponding letter.

| Letter | Position | Explanation                                                    |
|--------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| A      | Straight | No bend at the knees or hips                                   |
| B      | Pike     | Knees straight and bent at the hips                            |
| C      | Tuck     | Legs curled up into the body                                   |
| D      | Free     | A combination of the other positions (used for twisting dives) |

## Dive Sheets

### Dual Meets

Each diver at a dual meet must submit a dive sheet at the beginning of the meet with the dives they intend to compete signed by both the diver and a coach.
To compete officially, a diver must compete 6 dives which meet the following criteria:

- The first dive must be in the dive group of the week (explained below) and have a degree of difficulty of no more than 1.8.
- The remaining five dives must cover 4 of the 5 dive groups.

#### Diving Schedule

There is a focus on a different dive group for each week of the season.
The first dive of a diver's dive sheet must be in that dive group.
See the [schedule](/current-season/schedule) for the list of dive weeks.

## Dive Table

Each dive has an assigned degree of difficulty which acts as a multiplier on the scores given by the diving judges.
The harder the dive, the higher the degree of difficulty.
The table below lists the degree of difficulties for all of the allowed dives at the high school level.[^degree-of-difficulty-table]
