The list of rule changes to swimming and diving from the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) are as follows:

## 2022 – 2023 [^20222023]

__2-3-1, 2-4-4__: Moves all language from referencing end wall height Rule 2-3-1 and establishes new nationally recognized standards for newly constructed or renovated facilities after January 1, 2023.
<br>
__Rationale__: The new specifications provide consistency for high school swimming and adheres to national trends.

__2-4 Table__: Establishes new nationally recognized standards for newly constructed or renovated facilities after January 1, 2023.
<br>
__Rationale__: The new specifications provide consistency for high school swimming and adheres to national trends.

## 2021 – 2022 [^20212022]

__3-2-5__: Changes protocol for declaration of the lead-off swimmer in a relay to be submitted prior to the start of the event.
<br>
__Rationale__: The lead-off swimmer must be declared at the specified time and place prior to the start of the event, which is consistent with entry procedures for identification of all relay participants.

__3-3-5__: Permits competitors to wear suits providing full body coverage for religious reasons.
<br>
__Rationale__: Eliminates the need for state association authorization of suits providing full body coverage.
Added language allows for exercise of religious practice without creating a competitive advantage for the athlete.

__3-3-6b,c,d__: Permits the application of temporary adhesives for divers.
<br>
__Rationale__: Allows divers to protect themselves from hand slippage, minimizing risks for the diver.

__5-4-3 NOTE__: Clarifies protocol for conducting swim-offs and what purposes the time can be used.
<br>
__Rationale__: Updated language clarifies the impact of the swim-off time on future seedings.

__9-2-1__: During championship meets, new language establishes when diving boards should be open for practice if breaks between sessions extend longer than ten minutes.
<br>
__Rationale__: Defines when diving boards shall be made available for practice during the break between sessions of a championship meet unless the meet director establishes specific guidelines prior to the start of competition.

__9-3-7 PENALTIES, 9-5-2, 9-5-5, 9-7-4f, 9-7-5k, 9-8-2c__: Permits standing forward takeoffs, clearly defining the proper procedure for performing a standing forward takeoff and the protocol for application of the mandatory two-point deduction.
<br>
__Rationale__: The standing forward takeoff is a critical part of the educational process in teaching new dives.
This provision allows divers to participate in competition sooner and encourages growth in the sport.

__9-5-4b__: Clarifies that only four oscillations are permitted before the diver leaves the board.
<br>
__Rationale__: The removal of vague language clarifies the number of oscillations a diver may take while on the diving board.

__9-6-4__: Defines process to rectify announcing errors that occur during diving competition.
<br>
__Rationale__: Language establishes protocol when an announcer error occurs.
The diver should not be penalized for the error of meet personnel; the referee retains broad discretion to resolve such problems in the most equitable and efficient way possible.

## 2019 – 2020 [^20192020]

__3-3-1, 3-3-2, 3-3-2 PENALTIES, 3-3-3, 3-3-4 PENALTIES__: Rule 3-3 was reorganized to identify penalty protocol for specific uniform violations.
<br>
__Rationale__: All current language addressing suit coverage was moved to Rule 3-3-2.
The penalty associated with this rule was written to provide clear indication that the coach of the competitor should be notified when a violation of this nature has occurred.

__8-1-7, 8-2-1g, 8-2-2h, 8-2-3g, 8-2-4e, 8-3-5__: A legal finish now requires the competitor to contact either the touchpad or the finish end according to the finish rules pertaining to the stroke being swum.
<br>
__Rationale__: A competitor has legally completed the race once he/she touches the touchpad or the finish end.

__9-1-3__: The rule was updated to comply with current industry standards.
<br>
__Rationale__: Aligns with current diving board manufacturers installation directions.

9-4-Table: The degree of difficulty for back and reverse double somersaults was lowered to be consistent with back and reverse 1½ somersaults degrees of difficulty.
<br>
__Rationale__: Provides consistency of degree of difficulties assessed to back and reverse dives versus back and reverse somersaults.

__9-5-6__: Clarified descriptions of diving positions.
<br>
__Rationale__: Diving descriptions were adjusted to maintain consistency with national trends.

__9-7-4 NOTE (NEW)__: The diving referee may confer with a member of the diving panel regarding a possible unsatisfactory dive.
<br>
__Rationale__: Consistent with the diving referee’s capability of consulting with a designated member of the judging panel concerning a possible fail dive.

## 2018 – 2019 [^20182019]

Rule 1: Rule 1 has been reorganized to more accurately reflect and define meet specifications and organization.
<br>
__Rationale__: Clarifies and consolidates terminology and reorganizes sections to reflect the order in which rules appear in the rules book.

__2-4-5__: The 16.4-yard/15-meter marks must be visible on both sides of the pool deck.
<br>
__Rationale__: Although markings may be integrated into each lane marker/lane line, because the position of such floats are often irregular, the marks on the sides of the pool are the uniform default marking for all lanes.

__2-7-2b__: Backstroke starting ledges are not permitted in high school swimming.
<br>
__Rationale__: Clarifies that backstroke starting ledges are prohibited in high school swimming due to risk minimization.

__2-7-2c (NEW), 2-7-2 NOTE (NEW)__: Options for starting platform malfunctions are provided, and direction for malfunctioning swimming equipment has been re-organized.
<br>
__Rationale__: Clarifies directives when swimming equipment malfunctions or is non-compliant.

__4-2-1d__: The referee shall conduct a pre-meet conference with the starter, the coach and the captain of each team for all non-championship meets.
<br>
__Rationale__: Emphasizes the importance that participants are aware of all details associated with the event.

__4-5-3, 4-7__: The responsibilities of stroke inspectors and turn/finish judges can now be combined by the referee.
<br>
__Rationale__: Specifies when the availability of officials is limited, the referee has the option to staff the deck effectively and efficiently with available officials.

__5-1-2a__: In non-championship meets, the diving event maybe held first, last or simultaneously with the swimming events, in addition to the traditional placement as Event 5 between the 50-yard freestyle and the 100-yard butterfly.
<br>
__Rationale__: Allows for flexibility in conducting the diving event within the dual meet program which will permit more options for competing teams.

__5-3, 5-3-2, 5-3-6 NOTE__: Section 5-3 has been updated to provide lane and heat assignment protocol from the dual meet to the championship meet.
<br>
__Rationale__: Clarifies direction for situations in which the number of teams and/or entries cannot be equally divided into the number of available lanes.

__5-4-2__: New language provides scoring protocol based on pool facilities with differing numbers of available lanes.
<br>
__Rationale__: Clarifies protocol for number of qualifiers and scoring for facilities that have 4, 6, 8, 9, or 10 lanes available.

__9-4-6 NOTE 2 (NEW)__: The NOTE clarifies that it is permissible to conduct eleven-dive competitions during dual meets, double-dual meets, and other non-championship multi-team meets.
<br>
__Rationale__: Provides for additional options for competitors to prepare for tournament series events.

## 2017 – 2018 [^20172018]

__1-3-12__: (Definitions) State associations may determine meets that shall be considered as culminating meets, which utilize the championship meet format.
The championship meet format prescribes specific rules associated with team and individual entries, dual confirmation, declared false starts, and applicable penalties for violation of these rules.
Non-championship meets may also be conducted under championship meet format and are subject to all rules for a championship meet.

__3-3-2a__: (Uniforms) Consistent language has been established for all NFHS sports that describe what information is permitted on the uniform.
A competitor’s name, school name, school nickname and/or the school logo can be placed on the uniform, which consists of the suit and the cap.

__2-7-6, 3-4__: (Lap Counters) Lap counters are now permitted to count the competitor’s laps by changing the number to the next higher or lower number, as the competitor makes each turn at the starting end.

__3-6, 4-1-8__: (Conduct) Rule 3 was reorganized to provide consistency and clarity for penalties associated with various competitor and/or meet personnel conduct.
In addition, the rule pertaining to language regarding the prohibition of an official’s tobacco use at the competition site was moved from Rule 3-6 to Rule 4-1-8.

__4-6-4__: (Relay Takeoff Judges) Dual confirmation for relay takeoffs is now required for all championship meets.
Dual confirmation can be accomplished either (a) by two side judges observing the entire field or (b) by a combination of side and lane judges.
The referee and the starter may serve as the relay takeoff judges as well.

__8-3-5c, 4-6-1__: (Relay Events) On relays, the second, third and fourth swimmers are prohibited from taking off from the top of the starting block wedge.
Competitors must have at least one foot in contact with the starting platform in front of the starting block wedge during takeoff.
The responsibility to observe this aspect of this takeoff falls under the relay takeoff judge’s jurisdiction, and does not require dual confirmation.

__9-5-2__: (Form of the Dives) The word “additional” was removed from the description of the forward approach and the hurdle, clarifying the intent for hops, leaps and/or jumps to count toward the three-step requirement.

## 2016 – 2017 [^20162017]

__1-5-2, 3-6-1d__: Deck changing has been defined as changing into or out of a swimsuit when wearing just one suit in an area other than a permanent or temporary locker room, bathroom, changing room or other space designated for changing purposes.
Incidents of deck changing will result in the assessment of an unsporting behavior penalty.
<br>
__Rationale__: High school athletes should not be changing into or out of swimsuits except in designated changing areas.

__6-4-1b__: The protocol for determining an official time when a touch pad malfunctions on a lane was changed.
Backup buttons and/or watch times, as outlined in the protocol, will now determine the official time.
<br>
__Rationale__: Research indicates that the current practice of calculating the average difference between the automatic and backup timing systems, and adjusting the backup time in the malfunctioning lane(s) does not improve the accuracy of the final time.
Utilizing backup times without adjustment results in a final time that is just as accurate and avoids an exercise which is both time-consuming and difficult to perform during a meet.

__8-2-4c__: The final leg of the individual medley and the medley relay requires the swimmer to be at or past vertical toward the breast before any stroke, kick or propulsive motion.
<br>
__Rationale__: This language clarifies the required body position during the final leg of the individual medley and the medley relay.

9-4 Table: The Flying Back 1 SS (212) and the Flying Reverse 1 SS (312) have been removed from the NFHS Diving Table, while new dive (5142) has been added.
<br>
__Rationale__: The added dive is an intermediate step to performing more difficult dives listed on the diving table.

__9-5-5__: The balk has been more clearly defined and should be called when a diver assumes the starting position and he/she makes an obvious attempt to start the approach or press, and stops the continuous execution of the dive prior to the water entry.
<br>
__Rationale__: This rule change adds clarity and consistency to the balk call, requiring a diver to actually commence, then stop the dive.

__9-7-5q__: When using the forward approach, a dive is failed if, in the diving referee’s opinion, the diver performs an additional bounce(s) on the end of the board after the culminating hurdle.
<br>
__Rationale__: The forward approach shall begin with not less than three steps and finish with a hurdle, defined as a jump off one foot to a landing on both feet at the end of the board.
The diver should not be permitted to do an additional bounce prior to the take-off.

## 2015 – 2016 [^20152016]

__3-3-5, 6__: The prohibition of wearing jewelry has been removed from the rules for swimming and diving competition.
As in previous years, the wearing of a medical alert with the alert visible continues and is encouraged for the purposes of risk minimization.
<br>
__Rationale__: The prohibition of jewelry is not necessary in swimming and diving.
The wearing of jewelry ordinarily presents little risk of injury to either the competitor or opponents.
Elimination of the rule allows officials to focus on meet administration directly related to competition.
Coaches continue to have the obligation to see that competitors are properly equipped.

__4-1-7__: Requires swimming and diving officials dress in the same uniform attire as approved by the state association and no longer considers white as the default uniform.
<br>
__Rationale__: Due to the many variations in the officials uniform, it is more practical that the state association determine the appropriate swimming and diving uniform for officials.

__4-3-1a, b__: The starter may designate another individual to sound a device for the lead swimmer during the 500-yard/400-meter freestyle when the lead swimmer has two lengths plus 5 yards remaining in the race.
<br>
__Rationale__: During the 500-yard/400-meter freestyle event, the starter may have multiple tasks occurring at the same time.
The starter may designate another individual to sound a device for the lead swimmer during the 500-yard/400-meter freestyle with two lengths plus 5 yards remaining to swim in the race.

__9-6-1__: The judging panel in diving may or may not include the diving referee.
<br>
__Rationale__: Clarifies the diving referee may be one of the judges on the panel or a separate official.

## 2014 – 2015 [^20142015]

__3-3-4__: Reorganize to list the items a competitor may wear/use and clarifies that adhesives are not allowed for swimmers and/or divers.
Divers may wear tape or wraps for support and no longer limited to the wrist.
<br>
__Rationale__: Lists items a competitor may wear/use as it makes the rule easier to use and assists in compliance.
The change also prohibits the use of adhesives, such as sprays, as they become slick when wet and can interfere with performance of others.

__3-6-1, New 2, 3__: Delineates more clearly unsporting conduct, which results in removal from the meet and all events in which the competitor previously qualified, and unacceptable conduct, which carries a penalty of disqualification from the event.
Separates spectator conduct from athletes and coaches.
<br>
__Rationale__: More clearly defines what is considered unsporting conduct, with a resulting penalty of no further participation up to ejection from the competition area, and what actions are considered unacceptable conduct with a resulting penalty of disqualification
from that event.
Delineates in Rule 8‐3‐8b when a relay lead‐off time shall not be eligible for use as a qualification time or record.
Spectators are also separated from athletes and coaches when dealing with unsporting/unacceptable conduct.

__4-3-1 NOTE, 4‐2‐2 NOTE, 2‐7‐3 NOTE__: Prohibits the use of a pistol/starter’s pistol as the sounding device in interscholastic swimming.
<br>
__Rationale__: It is inappropriate to use a pistol of any kind at a school swimming meet.
Alternative sounding devices are readily available.

__8-1-5__: Swimmers no longer step off the starting platforms after the referee/starter gives the command, “Stand up.” Swimmers will be directed to step down only when unusual circumstances occur.
<br>
__Rationale__: For risk minimization, swimmers should not step off the starting platform unnecessarily once stepped up, especially with the track‐style starting platforms.
Referees and starters should direct swimmers to step down only when unusual circumstances occur.


__8-2-1e__: Specifies in the backstroke event, the swimmer shall remain on or above the water surface on the finish and cannot submerge.
<br>
__Rationale__: Specifies in the backstroke event, the swimmer shall remain on or above the water surface on the finish.
This can be accomplished with any body part and prevents premature submersion by a swimmer that could create an advantage.

__9-2-1__: Divers shall be permitted at least two practice approaches, with or without water entry, immediately prior to the start of diving competition.
