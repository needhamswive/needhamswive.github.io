## History

In 1958, the Bay State League was established.[^3]

In 1990, Brookline and Newton North joined the league, and the conference was changed to two divisions.
The leagues were named after Mr. Fran Carey and Mr. Fred Herget, and shall be considered Charter Divisional Members of the Bay State Conference.
The divisions are named the Carey Division (large division) and the Herget Division (small division) of the Bay State Conference (BSC).
Divisional placement is based completely on enrollment.[^3]
