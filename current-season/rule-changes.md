The list of rule changes to swimming and diving for the 2023-24 season from the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) are as follows: [^1]

__3-3 Note__: Moves the note to the beginning of Section 3 and adds language prohibiting accommodations altering compression, buoyancy, or competitive advantage.
<br>
__Rationale__: The section will make it clear this provision applies to all articles in Section 3.

__3-3-2__: Removes language which specifies that a competitor shall only be able to compete in a suit that is of decent appearance.
<br>
__Rationale__: Eliminates the subjectivity of “decent appearance” for an official when making an illegal suit determination.

__8-1-3d PENALTY 2, 8-1-6 PENALTY__: Added the requirement of a written record for dual confirmation of a false start.
<br>
__Rationale__: The change aligns language with the current requirement that when dual confirmation is used, the relay takeoff judges are required to report in writing any violations to the referee.

__8-2-1g__: Removes the language about some part of the body at or above the surface during a backstroke finish.
<br>
__Rationale__: The change aligns with national trends, allows the official to concentrate on the backstroke finish (wall touch), and may prevent lunging at the wall which reduces risk.

__8-2-2d-h__: Requires the arms and legs to move simultaneously but does not require the arms and legs to be in the same horizontal plane.
Also requires separation of the hands during the touch at turns and finish.
<br>
__Rationale__: Changes provide clarity, consistency, and alignment with national trends and do not provide a competitive advantage.

__8-2-3c, e, g__: Requires the separation of hands and a simultaneous touch with the hands during the turns and finish.
<br>
__Rationale__: Changes provide clarity, consistency, and alignment with national trends and do not provide a competitive advantage.

__9-5 Diving Table__: Removes dives 104A, 304A and 402A from the Diving Table.
<br>
__Rationale__: When each dive is performed slightly short of vertical, the diver’s head may be precariously close to the diving board.
The risk of hitting the board in these cases is far greater than other dives on the table.

__9-7-4c__: Adds a penalty for when a diver’s head is too close to the diving board.
The diving referee shall make the determination and inform diving judges to score the dive as unsatisfactory.
<br>
__Rationale__: Minimizes the risk factor of the diver performing the dive in a way that brings the diver’s head too close to the board.
