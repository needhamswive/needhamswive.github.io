Needham High School is a member of the [Bay State Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_State_Conference) comprising of 10 high schools in two divisions, divided by geography: the Carey Division (Brookline, Framingham, Natick, Newton North, and Wellesley) and the Herget Division (Braintree, Milton, Needham, Walpole, and Weymouth).[^1]
The 10 dual meets each season consist of the other 9 teams in the Bay State Conference as well as an out out-of-conference meet with Acton-Boxborough Regional High School.

High school swimming and diving is governed nationally by the [National Federation of State High School Associations](https://www.nfhs.org/activities-sports/swimming-diving/) (NFHS).
