Officials and Meet Staff  (Pre-Approved)
Will be able to park in the Kresge Lot located off of Amherst Street.  A list has been sent to the
Parking Office and a this lot will be staffed starting at 6:00am.

Spectator Parking:
Parking will be available at three locations which will open at 6:00am.  West Garage will be open with a
$5 parking fee (debit/credit card only).  We have added two free parking options for this meet.  West
Lot and West Gate Lot which are both located .5 mi down Vassar Street.  These lots are a quick 10 min
walk.  We ask all those who would like to park for free in these lots to enter Vassar Street via
Memorial Drive.  This will be a quicker approach and will limit the amount of traffic outside the venue.

Bus Drop-off and Parking:
We ask that buses DO NOT drop off meet participants right in front of the venue which causes traffic
congestion.  The Metropolitan Storage Warehouse has given us permission to use the cutout.  Once Buses
have dropped off the participants they are then asked to move to the Waverly Lot.
