MIAA Swim Tournaments at MIT<br/>Parking information<br/><br/><br/>Vassar Street Entrance:<br/>Construction to the steam pipe line continues in front of the venue.  We hope to finish construction by <br/>6am Friday.  Jody or I will send out an email letting you know if this happens.<br/><br/>Link to MIAA Fall Parking Map:  <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/8TfPa">http://goo.gl/maps/8TfPa</a><br/><br/>Officials and Meet Staff  (Pre-Approved)<br/>Will be able to park in the Kresge Lot located off of Amherst Street.  A list has been sent to the <br/>Parking Office and a this lot will be staffed starting at 6:00am.  <br/><br/>Spectator Parking:<br/>Parking will be available at three locations which will open at 6:00am.  West Garage will be open with a <br/>$5 parking fee (debit/credit card only).  We have added two free parking options for this meet.  West <br/>Lot and West Gate Lot which are both located .5 mi down Vassar Street.  These lots are a quick 10 min <br/>walk.  We ask all those who would like to park for free in these lots to enter Vassar Street via <br/>Memorial Drive.  This will be a quicker approach and will limit the amount of traffic outside the venue.<br/><br/>Bus Drop-off and Parking:<br/>We ask that buses DO NOT drop off meet participants right in front of the venue which causes traffic <br/>congestion.  The Metropolitan Storage Warehouse has given us permission to use the cutout.  Once Buses <br/>have dropped off the participants they are then asked to move to the Waverly Lot.<br/>
