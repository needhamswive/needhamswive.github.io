2012 STATE SWIMMING AND DIVING
PARKING INFORMATION:
All spectators will need to park across the street in the Business school lot for the duration of the
meet. This is due to the overwhelming popularity of Harvard basketball and the other events going on
within the complex. This makes it easier as individuals will not pull into the Athletic lot, only to be
turned around. The price is the same, $10 per day, per car.

Due to the large number of buses and other events going on within the complex, all buses will need to
drop off their student-athletes on North Harvard Street right in front of Blodgett, and then park either
at the 175/219 parking lot on the corner of North Harvard Avenue and Western Avenue; or the nearby
shopping center on Western Avenue. We have no agreement with the shopping center, but it is a large
shopping center so the bus can park there with the driver in place for the duration of the meet.
