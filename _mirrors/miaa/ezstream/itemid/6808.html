<pre style="font-size:11px;"><br/>2012 STATE SWIMMING AND DIVING<br/>PARKING INFORMATION:<br/>All spectators will need to park across the street in the Business school lot for the duration of the <br/>meet. This is due to the overwhelming popularity of Harvard basketball and the other events going on <br/>within the complex. This makes it easier as individuals will not pull into the Athletic lot, only to be <br/>turned around. The price is the same, $10 per day, per car.<br/> <br/>Due to the large number of buses and other events going on within the complex, all buses will need to <br/>drop off their student-athletes on North Harvard Street right in front of Blodgett, and then park either <br/>at the 175/219 parking lot on the corner of North Harvard Avenue and Western Avenue; or the nearby <br/>shopping center on Western Avenue. We have no agreement with the shopping center, but it is a large <br/>shopping center so the bus can park there with the driver in place for the duration of the meet.<br/></pre>
